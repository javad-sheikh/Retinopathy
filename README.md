# Retinopathy

In this project, I tried to make an android application for retinopathy detection. The Tensorflow DenseNet network was trained on Kaggle using the Kaggle retinopathy datasets. After that, the TFlite files were used in the android application to detect retinopathy.

In this application there are 2 ways for detection:
1- using the file manager to get the retina images
2- using the android device camera to detect retinopathy

This application was tested on retina images since I couldn't get the required lenses that sit on the android device the second way was not checked.
